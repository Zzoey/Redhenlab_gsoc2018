This project contains a pipeline to train, test and visualise *fine grained* activity recognition in videos. [MPII Cooking Activities](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-multimodal-computing/research/human-activity-recognition/mpii-cooking-activities-dataset/) dataset contains 65 cooking activities in 44 videos continously recorded in a realistic setting and is publicly available. Activities are distinguished by fine grained body motions which have high intra-class variance.

This project uses openpose to get the pose tracks and is based on the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07455). This work is part of a bigger project which aims to use multimodal features to detect and characterize emotion in videos.
